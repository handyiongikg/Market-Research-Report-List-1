<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Petroleum Flash Point Tester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Cup Flash Point Tester</li><li>Closed Cup Flash Point Tester</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The petroleum flash point tester market comprises two main types: open cup and closed cup flash point testers. Open cup testers determine flash points using an open container, allowing vapor exposure to air, which typically measures higher flash points. In contrast, closed cup testers use a sealed environment, reducing vapor exposure and providing more accurate measurements for low flash point liquids. Both types are essential for assessing flammability and safety in petroleum product handling and storage.</p></p>
