<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crystal Pullers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Czochralski (CZ) Method Furnace</li><li>Floating Zone (FZ) Method Furnace</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Crystal pullers encompass various methods for growing single crystals, primarily the Czochralski (CZ) and Floating Zone (FZ) methods. The CZ method involves melting polycrystalline material in a crucible, allowing a seed crystal to be pulled upwards, forming large, high-quality crystals suitable for electronics. In contrast, the FZ method uses a zoned melting technique without a crucible, ensuring purity and avoiding contamination, making it ideal for specialized applications. Both markets are vital for semiconductor, photovoltaic, and optoelectronic industries.</p></p>
